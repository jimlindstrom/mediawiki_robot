This is a framework for creating robots for (automated scripts that interact 
with) Mediawiki-based wikis.  Mediawiki is the software that powers Wikipedia,
and is very popular.

One common use case is to monitor changes on a wiki, and take some action
per change (detect spam, enforce policies, record statistics, etc).  

This gem allows you to do that by coding only the change handling method.  The
work of logging in, monitoring changes, checking page revision numbers and
whatnot is handled by this gem.

For an example robot built on this framework see:
